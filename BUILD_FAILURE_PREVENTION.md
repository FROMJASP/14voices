# Build Failure Prevention Summary

## Changes Made to Prevent Future Build Failures

### 1. Fixed Immediate Issue

- **Moved @sentry/nextjs from devDependencies to dependencies** in package.json
- This was causing "Module not found" errors on Vercel because Vercel doesn't install devDependencies

### 2. Added Automated Validation Scripts

- **`bun run validate:deps`** - Checks that no devDependencies are imported in production code
- **`bun run validate:architecture`** - Validates domain boundaries and code organization
- **`bun run validate:build`** - Tests the production build locally
- **`bun run validate:full`** - Runs all validations including architecture and dependencies

### 3. Enhanced Git Hooks

- **Pre-push hook** now validates dependencies before allowing push
- Prevents broken code from reaching the remote repository

### 4. Added CI/CD Pipeline

- GitHub Actions workflow validates every push and PR
- Tests both Bun (local) and npm (Vercel) environments
- Catches issues before they reach production

### 5. Updated Documentation

- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with:
  - Detailed build failure prevention guide
  - Emergency build fix procedures
  - Common failure causes and solutions
  - Mandatory pre-deployment checklist

## How to Prevent Future Build Failures

### Before Every Push:

```bash
# Run full validation
bun run validate:full

# This runs:
# - Linting
# - Formatting check
# - TypeScript type checking
# - Unit tests
# - Dependency validation
# - Architecture validation
# - Production build test
```

### Key Rules:

1. **Dependencies**: If it's imported in `src/`, it MUST be in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`
2. **Type Checking**: Always run `bun run typecheck` before pushing
3. **Build Test**: Run `bun run validate:build` to test production build locally
4. **Use Validation**: The pre-push hook will catch most issues automatically

### If Build Fails on Vercel:

1. Check the error message - usually it's a missing module
2. Find the module in package.json
3. If it's in devDependencies, move it to dependencies
4. Run `bun install`
5. Test with `bun run validate:build`
6. Commit and push the fix

## Why This Keeps Happening

Vercel's build environment is different from local development:

- Vercel uses npm, not Bun
- Vercel doesn't install devDependencies in production
- Type errors that TypeScript ignores locally can fail on Vercel

The new validation system catches these differences before deployment.
