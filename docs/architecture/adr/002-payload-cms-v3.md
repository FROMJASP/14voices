# ADR 002: Use Payload CMS v3 for Content Management

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed a headless CMS that could:

- Handle complex data relationships
- Provide a good admin interface
- Support TypeScript natively
- Integrate well with Next.js
- Handle authentication and access control
- Scale with our needs

## Decision

We chose Payload CMS v3 (beta) for the following reasons:

- Native TypeScript support with type generation
- Built on Next.js, allowing seamless integration
- Powerful access control system
- Excellent admin UI out of the box
- PostgreSQL support via Drizzle ORM
- Extensible with custom React components
- Good developer experience

## Consequences

### Positive

- Single codebase for frontend and CMS
- Type-safe data models
- Powerful query capabilities
- Built-in authentication
- Easy to extend admin UI
- Good performance with PostgreSQL

### Negative

- Using beta version (v3.0.0-beta.135)
- Limited community resources for v3
- Breaking changes possible
- Learning curve for team

## Implementation

- Integrated Payload with Next.js app
- Created collections for all data models
- Implemented custom admin components
- Set up access control per collection
- Generated TypeScript types from schema
