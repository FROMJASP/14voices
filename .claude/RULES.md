[3] Changelog|Algorithms [2] Doc examples [1] Modern syntax
14Voices [3]: Demo organization | [2]: Audio optimization | [1]: TypeScript modern features
```

## 3. 14Voices Specific Rules

### Build-First Philosophy [C:10]

```yaml
Local Build: bun run build â†’ MUST succeed before any Vercel discussion
Type Generation: bun payload generate:types â†’ After schema changes | Before commits | Keep current
Environment: .env.local complete | Match Vercel settings | All secrets configured
Dependencies: package.json current | Lock files committed | No version conflicts
Pre-Commit: Build validation | Type checking | ESLint passing | Test execution
Debug Protocol: Local success â†’ Environment check â†’ Dependency validation â†’ Vercel analysis
NEVER: Push without local build | Debug on Vercel first | Copy-paste errors repeatedly
```

### Git Safety Protocols [C:10]

```yaml
NEVER: Start Claude Code session without clean git status | Make major changes without commits | Experiment without safety branch
ALWAYS: git add . && git commit before experiments | Push frequently to GitHub | Create feature branches for big changes
Safety Net: Every change tracked | Recovery always possible | GitHub as backup | Branches for experiments
Emergency Recovery: git log â†’ identify good state â†’ git reset --hard â†’ back to safety
Checkpoint Pattern: Before refactoring â†’ git commit -m "Before major refactor" â†’ experiment â†’ rollback if needed
Branch Strategy: main (production) | develop (integration) | feature/* (experiments) | hotfix/* (urgent fixes)
```

### VSCode + Git Integration [H:8]

```yaml
IDE Workflow: /ide + git integration + real-time status + easy commits + push immediately
Safety Commands: git status | git add -p | git commit -m | git push | git log --oneline
Recovery Commands: git stash | git reset | git checkout | git revert | git cherry-pick
Branch Management: git checkout -b feature/name | git merge | git rebase | git branch -d
Session Safety: Start with clean status â†’ commit before changes â†’ push after success â†’ tag releases
```

### Code Quality Standards [H:8]

```yaml
Duplication: Detect patterns | Extract shared components | Create utility functions | Consolidate solutions
Component Reuse: Shared component library | Consistent patterns | Single source of truth | Type sharing
Utility Functions: Common logic extraction | Shared helpers | Type utilities | Business logic centralization
Pattern Consistency: One way to do things | Standard approaches | Documented patterns | Team conventions
```

### Business Critical Rules [C:10]

```yaml
Order Flow: Zero failure tolerance | Complete testing required | Payment processing reliable | Email automation working
Customer Experience: Demo loading <2s | Order submission <1s | Mobile optimized | Audio streaming smooth
Revenue Protection: Payment webhooks verified | Stripe integration secure | Invoice generation automatic | Refund handling correct

Offer: "Notice Xâ†’Yâ†’Z. Create shortcut?" | Remember if declined
14Voices: Build failure patterns | Duplication locations | Payload customization attempts | Standard solutions preferred
```

## 5. 14Voices Debugging Protocols

### Build Failure Resolution [C:10]

```yaml
