## Automatic Agent Selection

### How Claude Automatically Uses Agents

When you type any prompt, Claude analyzes it and automatically delegates to the appropriate agents. You don't need to explicitly call agents - just describe what you want!

### Pattern Recognition

Claude recognizes these patterns and automatically involves the right agents:

**UI/Design Requests**

- "Make this section more modern" → ui-designer
- "Improve user experience" → ux-designer → ui-designer
- "Add animations" → ui-designer
- "Fix layout issues" → debugger → ui-designer

**Technical Tasks**

- "Optimize database queries" → database-optimizer
- "Fix this bug" → debugger
- "Add payment processing" → api-engineer → security-engineer
- "Deploy to production" → deployment-engineer

**Quality & Testing**

- "Test the checkout flow" → test-runner
- "Review this code" → code-reviewer
- "Check security" → security-engineer
- "Improve performance" → performance-engineer

**Feature Development**

- "Add user reviews feature" → product-manager → ux-designer → ui-designer → api-engineer → test-runner

### Context Management

#### Quick Context (For Each Agent)

```markdown
## Current Task: [Specific task for this agent]

## Previous Work: [What other agents have done]

## Dependencies: [What this agent needs to know]

## Next Steps: [What happens after this agent]
```

#### Context Flow Rules

1. **Minimal Context**: Each agent receives only what they need
2. **Clear Handoffs**: Explicit documentation of decisions
3. **No Information Loss**: Critical details preserved across agents
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Coordinator resolves any disagreements

## Common Workflows

### UX → UI → Review Workflow

When user requests UI/UX improvements:

1. **Delegate to ux-designer first**
   - "Use ux-designer to analyze and prototype [feature]"
   - Wait for functional HTML prototype
   - Review and get user approval

2. **Then delegate to ui-designer**
   - "Use ui-designer to polish the approved UX prototype"
   - Provide the functional prototype as context
   - Ensure UX decisions are preserved

3. **Finally delegate to code-reviewer**
   - "Use code-reviewer to verify security and best practices"
   - Check for framework compliance
   - Ensure latest API usage
   - Validate accessibility

### Quick Security Check

For any delivered code:

- "Use code-reviewer to validate [component]"
- Address any issues found
- Re-review if needed

### Direct UI Request

When user asks for specific UI components without UX needs:

- Skip UX phase
- Direct to ui-designer immediately

### Decision Tree

```
Is it a user experience problem?
├─ Yes → Start with ux-designer
│   └─ After approval → ui-designer
└─ No → Is it purely visual?
    ├─ Yes → ui-designer only
    └─ No → Evaluate needed agents
```

## Handoff Management

Ensure smooth transitions:

- Document what was validated in UX
- Specify what UI should enhance
- Maintain clear boundaries
- Track decisions through memory MCP

## Example Scenarios

**"Add reviews section with Trustpilot"**
→ Product Manager first (requirements)
→ Then UX Designer (user flow)
→ Then UI Designer (visual design)
→ Finally Code Reviewer (validation)

**"Improve the checkout flow"**
→ UX first (flow optimization)
→ Then UI (visual enhancement)

**"Add animations to buttons"**
→ UI only (pure visual)

**"Make navigation easier to use"**
→ UX first (usability)
→ Then UI (visual clarity)

**"Create a modern hero section"**
→ Depends on context:

- If layout unclear → UX first
- If layout defined → UI only

## Deployment Workflow

When deployment issues arise:

1. **Delegate to deployment-engineer**
   - "Use deployment-engineer to diagnose build failure"
   - Review error logs and solutions
   - Implement fixes

2. **Then verify with code-reviewer**
   - Ensure fixes don't introduce new issues
   - Validate deployment configuration

3. **Finally test deployment**
   - Deploy to preview/staging first
   - Run test-runner on preview
   - Deploy to production if successful

## Payment Implementation Workflow

When implementing payment features:

1. **Start with API Engineer**
   - "Use api-engineer to implement Stripe payment flow"
   - Design payment architecture
   - Implement Stripe Connect if needed
   - Set up webhook handling
   - Create idempotent payment service

2. **Security Review with Security Engineer**
   - "Use security-engineer to ensure PCI compliance"
   - Verify no card data storage
   - Check tokenization implementation
   - Validate webhook signatures
   - Review payment logs for PII

3. **Database Design with Database Optimizer**
   - "Use database-optimizer to design payment schema"
   - Create payment tables
   - Design for audit trails
   - Optimize for payment queries

4. **Performance Testing**
   - "Use performance-engineer to optimize checkout flow"
   - Test payment processing speed
   - Optimize webhook processing
   - Ensure resilient retry logic

5. **End-to-End Testing**
   - "Use test-runner to verify payment flows"
   - Test successful payments
   - Test failed payments
   - Test subscription lifecycle
   - Test refund flows

### Payment Decision Tree

```
Is it a payment feature?
├─ Yes → What type?
│   ├─ One-time payment → API Engineer
│   ├─ Subscription → API Engineer + extensive testing
│   └─ Marketplace payout → API Engineer (Stripe Connect)
└─ No → Regular workflow

Payment security check needed?
├─ Always → Security Engineer review
└─ Especially for:
    ├─ New payment forms
    ├─ Stored payment methods
    └─ Recurring billing
```

## Team Collaboration Protocols

### Multi-Agent Task Execution

When Claude receives your prompt, it automatically:

1. **Analyzes Intent**: Understands what you're trying to achieve
2. **Selects Agents**: Chooses the right specialists for the task
3. **Sequences Work**: Determines optimal order of operations
4. **Manages Handoffs**: Ensures smooth context transfer
5. **Synthesizes Results**: Combines all agent outputs

### Example: "Improve the booking flow to increase conversions"

Claude automatically orchestrates:

```
1. 📋 product-manager
   → Analyzes current conversion metrics
   → Defines success criteria
   → Creates requirements

2. 🧠 ux-designer
   → User journey mapping
   → Identifies friction points
   → Creates optimized flow

3. 🎨 ui-designer
   → Implements visual improvements
   → Adds trust signals
   → Enhances CTA buttons

4. 🔌 api-engineer
   → Optimizes booking API
   → Implements progress saving
   → Adds error recovery

5. ⚡ performance-engineer
   → Reduces form load time
   → Optimizes validation
   → Improves responsiveness

6. ✅ test-runner
   → A/B test setup
   → Conversion tracking
   → User acceptance testing

7. 🔍 code-reviewer
   → Security validation
   → Best practices check
   → Final approval
```

### Conflict Resolution

When agents disagree:

1. **Performance vs Security**: Security takes precedence
2. **UX vs Technical**: Find balanced solution
3. **Speed vs Quality**: Quality for critical paths
4. **Feature vs Stability**: Stability first

### Best Practices for Users

To get the best results:

1. **Be Specific**: "Improve checkout" → "Reduce checkout abandonment by simplifying the payment form"
2. **Provide Context**: Share relevant files, errors, or screenshots
3. **State Goals**: Explain what success looks like
4. **Trust the Process**: Let agents work together

### Knowledge Retention

The team remembers:

- Previous decisions and rationale
- Patterns that worked well
- Common issues and solutions
- User preferences

This enables continuous improvement and consistent results across sessions.
