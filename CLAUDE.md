bun test:e2e             # Run Playwright E2E tests
bun test:e2e:ui          # Run Playwright tests with UI

# Code quality
bun run lint             # Run ESLint
bun run format           # Format code with Prettier
bun run format:check     # Check formatting

# Payload CMS
bun payload generate:types      # Generate TypeScript types after schema changes
bun payload generate:importmap  # Generate import map after adding custom components
bun payload migrate            # Run database migrations

# Database seeding
bun run seed             # Seed database with sample data
```

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.4.5 with App Router
- **CMS**: Payload CMS 3.49.1 - Headless CMS with PostgreSQL
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via @payloadcms/db-postgres)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Package Manager**: Bun (required - npm/yarn will not work)
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E)
- **Email**: Resend API with custom email marketing system
- **Storage**: Vercel Blob for media/documents

### Domain-Driven Design

Each domain follows a consistent structure:

```
src/domains/{domain}/
├── types/          # Domain-specific TypeScript types
├── services/       # Business logic and orchestration
├── repositories/   # Data access layer
└── index.ts        # Public API exports
```

- [Architecture Decision Records](./docs/architecture/adr/)

## Key Development Patterns

### API Routes

- Use domain services instead of direct Payload access
- Validate input with Zod schemas
- Handle errors gracefully
- Return consistent response formats

### Component Organization

- `admin/` - Payload admin customizations only
- `features/` - Complex feature-specific components
- `ui/` - Simple, reusable UI components
- `widgets/` - Self-contained widget components
- `layout/` - Page layout components
- `sections/` - Page section components

### Type Safety

- Generate types after schema changes: `bun payload generate:types`
- Use generated types from `@/payload-types`
- Domain types in `src/domains/{domain}/types`
- Shared types in `src/types/shared`

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests with Vitest for utilities and services
- Integration tests for API routes
- E2E tests with Playwright for critical user flows
- Run before committing: `bun test`

### Performance Optimization

- Use React Server Components by default
- Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize images with Next.js Image component
- Lazy load heavy components

### Security Best Practices

- Validate all user input with Zod
- Use Payload's built-in auth for protected routes
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Never expose sensitive data in client components
