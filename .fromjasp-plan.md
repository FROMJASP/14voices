# FromJasp Execution Plan

**Task**: design a beautiful and responsive new navbar which admins can edit
**Workflow**: UI/Design
**Required MCPs**: filesystem, memory, context7, web_search

## Instructions:

1. Use filesystem MCP to scan src/components for existing similar components
2. Use memory MCP to recall previously created components and patterns
3. Use context7 MCP to fetch components from GitHub sources:
   - PaceUI: For text animations, cursors, buttons
   - Animate UI (https://github.com/animate-ui/animate-ui): For page transitions, motion effects
   - React Bits (https://github.com/DavidHDev/react-bits): For patterns and best practices
4. Use web_search to find inspiration from 21st.dev and modern examples
5. Present 3-5 options with:
   - Preview links to the GitHub source
   - Component names and descriptions
   - Dependencies required (GSAP, Framer Motion, etc.)
6. WAIT for user selection (don't build until approved)
7. After approval:
   - Fetch selected component code
   - Adapt to project standards (TypeScript, no 'any', Tailwind classes)
   - Implement with proper attribution in comments
   - Run prettier formatting
   - Commit with attribution in message

## Critical Project Rules (from RULES.md):

- ✅ ALWAYS use bun (NEVER npm/yarn/pnpm)
- ✅ Build locally first (bun run build must succeed)
- ✅ NO 'any' types in TypeScript
- ✅ Check for existing components before creating new ones
- ✅ Generate types after schema changes (bun payload generate:types)
- ✅ Extract duplicate code immediately
- ✅ Run prettier on all modified files
- ✅ Performance targets: API <200ms, Demo loading <2s, Build <60s

## Component Sources:

- **PaceUI**: Built-in MCP for text animations, cursors, buttons
- **Animate UI**: https://github.com/animate-ui/animate-ui for transitions
- **React Bits**: https://github.com/DavidHDev/react-bits for patterns
- **21st.dev**: https://21st.dev for modern inspiration

## Execution Steps:

1. Read CLAUDE.md for complete workflows and context
2. Read RULES.md for critical rules that must be followed
3. Execute the task following the workflow above
4. Verify all rules are followed before committing
